The main benefit of an online trading account is the ease with which you can manage your stock portfolios without middlemen/brokers. It also gives you greater control to trust your own intuitions and take risks with your investments. Besides, the speed of transactions increases, as everything can be done instantaneously. In a traditional set-up, one had to contact his stockbroker, who would then negotiate the price with the trader and place the order. This would often result in transaction delays.

Am I eligible to open a trading account?
Any individual can open a trading account, as long as they have an identity proof and an address proof. These documents are necessary while opening a trading and a demat account. You can provide your voter’s ID, PAN card, driver’s license, passport or bills as identity proof. As proof of address, ration card, driving license, bank passbook, voter’s ID, electricity bill, telephone bill, etc. can be submitted. You should also have a savings account, as it is needed to transfer/receive money when you buy/sell shares through your trading account. It is advisable to
open a trading account
once you are well versed with the fundamentals of trading.
How can I open an online trading account?
The first step to open an online trading account, is selecting a broker or a firm. Make sure that the broker/firm is registered with the Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Select the best service provider based on its reputation, service provided, security, brokerage fees and consultancy services. Once you’ve finalized the broker, fill the account opening form, either online, or collect it from the branch. Along with the duly filled form, submit the required KYC documents, such as your identity proof and address proof. Post verification of the application, you will receive your trading account details. You can then make online transactions and manage your stock portfolios, as per your convenience.
How long does it take to open an online trading account?
The time taken to open an online trading account depends on the processing time. Normally, it takes about a week’s time for the verification and processing of the documents.
Sometimes, applicants may face issues during the application; e.g. some may enter a different address in their Account Opening Form and their address proof may have a different address. In such cases, the verification process make take longer than expected, thus causing a delay in the opening of the account. Once, the verification of documents is done, a welcome kit is dispatched to you with your trading details.
How many bank and depository accounts can I link to a trading account?
You can link as many trading accounts as you have, to a demat account, provided that your stockbroker has the Power of Attorney (PoA) for that demat account. It is necessary for the stockbroker to have PoA, as shares can then be pulled from the client’s account. When you purchase shares, you have the option of sending the shares to the same demat account through multiple trading accounts. However, while selling, you can do so with one trading account (the account for which the PoA is mapped with demat).
There are not many advantages of opening multiple trading accounts, except that the brokerage charges are less. Instead, you have to keep track of multiple accounts, access your accounts through multiple platforms, and check multiple P&L statements, which may not be feasible.
